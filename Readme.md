The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This will be graded by peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. The following will be included.

1. a tidy data set as described below
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

A description of the dataset being used can be found here: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
